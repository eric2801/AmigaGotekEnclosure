# AmigaGotekEnclosure
3D printable [Amiga-style](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/X1611.99E) enclosure for [Gotek](https://www.ami64.com/product-page/advanced-gotek-usb-flash-drive-for-amiga).

This enclosure fits [this model of Gotek](https://www.ami64.com/product-page/advanced-gotek-usb-flash-drive-for-amiga), which is the only one I have for measuring proper fit.  If you have a different model, I cannot guarantee compatibility.  Feel free to modify the mounting design as needed, and contribute back to this repo.
