# AmigaGotekEnclosure
3D printable [Amiga-style](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/X1611.99E) enclosure for [Gotek](https://www.ami64.com/product-page/advanced-gotek-usb-flash-drive-for-amiga).

This enclosure fits [this model of Gotek](https://www.ami64.com/product-page/advanced-gotek-usb-flash-drive-for-amiga), which is the only one I have for measuring proper fit.  If you have a different model, I cannot guarantee compatibility.  Feel free to modify the mounting design as-needed, and contribute back to this repo if you wish.

For good colour-matching with my Amiga, I am using [Jessie Beige by Printed Solid](https://www.printedsolid.com/collections/jessie/products/jessie-pla-1-75mm-x-1kg-beige-500).
